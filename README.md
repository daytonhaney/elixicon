def deps do
  [
    {:elixicon, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

### elixr  
 
  -  provides a complete development environment

         - testing
         - documentation
         - logging
         - distrubuted computing (erlang nodes)

  - functional pradigm with heavy emphasis on patterm matching

         - no concept of assignment
         - " = " sign is the match operator

  - return types are always implied

  - passing references to funnctions is 

  - consicness and tersity of elixir code may appear incredibly complex compared to OO, however efficient

  - repl driven development, no real way to run code blocks from a .ex file

  - user defined types and OO programming  **is** the natual way to model a system, imo
  
  - std lib is filled with incredibly useful elixir wrapped erlang functions. example: Enum.shuffle()
   
  - truthy and falsy non existent
Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
