### elixir

- provides a complete development environment

  - testing
  - documentation
  - logging
  - memory store
  - distributed computing (erlang nodes)

- functional paradigm with heavy emphasis on pattern matching

  - no concept of assignment
  - " = " sign is the match operator

- modules are objects in memory that have zero concept of a class or instance of a class or variable

- return types are always implied

- passing references to functions ...

- concisenes of elixir code may appear incredibly complex compared to OO, however efficient

- repl driven development, no real way to run code blocks from a .ex file

- user defined types and OO programming **is** the natural way to model a system, imo

- std lib is filled with incredibly useful elixir wrapped erlang functions. example: Enum.shuffle()

- truthy and falsy non existent
